    'description' => "The Conversations on Decoloniality & Fashion is an online series initiated by the Research Collective for Decoloniality and Fashion in February 2021. This virtual platform beyond institutional, disciplinary and geographical boundaries aims to experiment with decolonial and decentral ways of knowledge-creation and sharing regarding fashion â€“ through the relational and conversational, the communal and coalitional, and through a radical act of listening across multiple differences. Transcending academe, its main aim is to disrupt stubbornly persistent Eurocentric underpinnings of dominant fashion and encourage critical analysis and dialogue into an erased and denied diversity.",
