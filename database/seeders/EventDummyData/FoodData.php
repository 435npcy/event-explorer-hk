    It is a shared experience that includes everyone around the table and creates a communal feeling for all those involved.
    
    In addition to its flavourful dishes, stews and spices, the cuisines also feature a strong culture around how food is served and shared with friends and family.
    
    Above all, eating injera with your hands and feeling its texture by itself is a lot of fun! A cup of Ethiopian coffee will be also served.
