    'description' => 'Best Guided Meditation for Kids

    How can I help my child focus? How can I help my child manage emotions like stress and anxiety? Can my kids learn meditation? These are questions parents often ask us. As parents, we want to do our best to help our children, but we don’t have all the answers.
    
    Discover how meditation can help your child manage emotions, focus better, lessen everyday stress and anxiety, and even sleep better. We will introduce your child to a simple guided meditation that will help them to overcome challenges and become truly happy, self-confident, and compassionate individuals.
    
    What our kids say about the meditation, “fun,” “refreshing,” and “light.” They say they “feel calmer, happier, more focused, and less selfish.” Even parents tell us how much they enjoy being in the class with their children.
    
    Give your children the tools they need to have a deeper understanding of themselves and enjoy a happy, and healthy life.
    
    Join us! Our program is interactive and fun. Make new friends! Turn this time of isolation into an opportunity to strengthen your child’s well-being.',
