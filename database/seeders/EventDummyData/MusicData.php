    'description' => "Early Bird: 180HKD

    Walk-in: 250 HKD
    
    Another year of The Aftermath's Battle of the Bands has once again four great indie bands performing their best original music in the hopes of winning the grand prize of being HK's top emerging band. So get ready to experience highly energized performances by Fist Bump, The Funkaphones, Warior Monk and Whitt's End. Joining this awesome live music event are special guest bands, RIDDEM and Parallel Horizons.
    
    Fist Bump - FIST BUMP is a Hong Kong pop punk band formed in 2022. Members include Kan Lo (Vocalist, Guitarist), Kirk (Bassist), Ronny (Drummer). They are all come from another band called “Sugar Bro”. The band won the championship in different competitions including: PLANETROX CHINA FINAL 2016; HOUSE OF VANS - MUSICIANS WANTED 2016 HK Final and YAMAHA Asian Beat HK Final.
    
    The Funkaphones - The 'Funkaphones' is a group of international musicians who came together magically at a HK jam session. Spontaneous creativity soon progressed into a distinct blend of sounds- mixing an etherial Wurlitzer with the funky strumming of an electric guitar and groovy drum beats. Part funk, part pop, and part plain fun, 'The Funkaphones' will make you feel like you've been warped to the 70's with the same outfit you wore to the show. Think Hall and Oates meets Maroon 5. The band's catchy grooves and quirky lyrics will make you glad you bought those second hand dancing shoes.
    
    Warrior Monk -
    
    Whitt's End - The hottest young guns in town who play a scorching style of pop rock music.

    Karen is a singer, songwriter, and musician who has been performing for over 20 years. She has been writing music since with a little conservative and shyness, and she always been drawn to the power of words and melodies to convey emotion.
    
    She loves collaborating with others on new music and exploring different sounds. It's so exciting when you get together with other artists who want to make something new happen!
    
    Her current project is MK BBGIRL—a fusion of her initials and her favorite nickname (Karen). It's a combination of all the styles of music that she loves: pop, rock, country, jazz…you name it! It's an expression of her identity as an artist: a woman who is comfortable in her own skin while still being able to explore the world through her art!
